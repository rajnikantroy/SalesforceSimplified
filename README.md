# Salesforce Simplified Chrome Extension: Enhancing Efficiency for Developers

The Salesforce Simplified Chrome extension is designed to streamline the daily tasks of Salesforce developers by providing quick access to essential data points directly from the UI. Whether working on any module, having recently created or modified data readily available can significantly improve productivity by reducing unnecessary clicks. With advanced search capabilities, Salesforce Simplified helps you find your code with just a few clicks.

## Features of Salesforce Simplified

Salesforce Simplified is divided into two main parts: Recent Items Viewer and Whole Org Search.

### Recent Items Viewer

- Debug logs
- Classes
- Pages
- Components
- Triggers
- Objects
- Fields
- Labels
- Workflows
- Flows
- Email Templates
- Static Resources

### Whole Org Search

The Whole Org Search feature, enhanced by Advanced Search functionality, includes the following components:

- Debug logs
- Classes
- Pages
- Components
- Triggers
- Objects
- Fields
- Labels

## Advanced Search

Advanced Search allows users to search for metadata names with links across the entire org, covering components like Debug logs, Classes, Pages, Components, Triggers, Objects, Fields, Labels, Workflows, Flows, Email Templates, and Static Resources.

### Change User

This functionality enables users to switch accounts to view recently created data by different users.

### Debug Logs

Locating debug logs in Salesforce can be challenging, especially when multiple users are generating logs simultaneously. With this feature, users can filter and view only their debug logs.

### Classes, Pages, Components, Triggers, Objects, Fields, Labels, Workflows, Flows, Email Templates, and Static Resources

All these components are displayed in descending order based on their creation or modification date, making it easy to access the most recent changes.
